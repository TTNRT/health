Here is our usage report for US Midwest and US East. Please note that some information may be outdated. If so, submit an issue to this repo with further details on the issue you reported.

## US East
US East usage for today is very stable, with our hosting provider having quite a bit of storms last month. So far, this winter is mostly stable, however without storms in place. Otherwise, this site is a good state.

## US Midwest
Our location has been hit hard by snow storms throughout January this year. Considering we didn't have any snow over Christmas, as well as for New Years Eve, it has snowing hard during the first 2 weeks of that month in general. Our location is mostly cold during the writing of this report. However, snow as of now was about 2 feet for about a day or two. Otherwise, the weather is stable, and no other conditions have been reported.
